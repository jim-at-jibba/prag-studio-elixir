# Servy

**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `servy` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:servy, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/servy>.

## Course notes

- `.ex` are compiled files, `.exs` interpreted as scripts
- in *iex*, if you want to load a module - `c "lib/[module_name]"`
- You can also just run `iex -S mix` - in the context of our mix project
- To recompile, in iex `r [module_name]`
- Think about *transformations*
